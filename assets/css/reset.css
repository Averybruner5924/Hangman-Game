/* I did not get to the css as I was focusing on the javascript but I wanted to set the background equal to an image of a TV screen. The z index of the image would be negative so it would remain in the background. I planned on using google fonts to find a similar font to cartoon networks logo to make the title of the game. I would change the title of the game so that it is large and centered. The remaining elements would be centered and in a google font that coordinated with the title font. All the elements font-color would be white and the word would be in a font-color of lime green. Additionally the counter font-color would become red after it hit 5.*/
